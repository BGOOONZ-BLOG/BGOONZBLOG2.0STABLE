Creating frontend routes</li>\n<li>React Router helps your app render specific components based on the URL.</li>\n<li>The most common component is &#x3C;Route></li>\n<li>Wrapped around another component, causing the comp. to only render if the a certain URL is matched.</li>\n<li>Props : path, component, exact, and [render]</li>\n<li>Browser Router can only have a single child component.</li>\n<li>The Browser Router wraps all routes within a parent div element.</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>component</li>\n<li>Indicates component to render.</li>\n<li>path</li>\n<li>Indicates path to render a specific component.</li>\n<li>exact</li>\n<li>Tells route to not pattern match and only render a certain route exclusively to it’s associated component.</li>\n<li>render</li>\n<li>Optional prop that takes in a function to be called.</li>\n<li>Causes extra work for React.</li>\n<li>Preferred for inline rendering of simple functional components.</li>\n<li>Difference between component and render is that component returns new JSX that be re-mounted, but render returns the JSX that will be mounted only once.</li>\n<li>// This inline rendering will work, but is unnecessarily slow. &#x3C;Route path=”/hello” component={() => &#x3C;h1>Hello!&#x3C;/h1>} /> // This is the preferred way for inline rendering. &#x3C;Route path=”/hello” render={() => &#x3C;h1>Hello!&#x3C;/h1>} /></li>\n<li>Also useful if you need to pass in specific props to a component.</li>\n<li>// `users` to be passed as a prop: const users = { 1: { name: “Andrew” }, 2: { name: “Raymond” }, }; &#x3C;Route path=”/users” render={() => &#x3C;Users users={users} />} />;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Route path params</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your component’s props can hold information about URL’s parameters.</li>\n<li>Will match segments starting at : to the next /, ?, #.</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>{...props} spreads out the router's props.</li>\n<li>props.match.params is used to access the match prop's parameters.</li>\n<li>Useful keys on the match object:</li>\n<li>isExact : boolean that tells you whether or not the URL exactly matches the path.</li>\n<li>url : the currentURL</li>\n<li>path : Route path it matched against (w/o wildcards)</li>\n<li>params : Matches for the individual wildcard segments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Navigation</h1>\n<p>React Router Navigation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Link, NavLink, Redirect, history props of React Router are used to help your user navigate routes.

(default set to 'active')</li>\n<li>activeStyle : style object that is applied inline when it's to prop. matches the current URL.</li>\n<li>exact prop is a boolean that defaults to false; you can set it to true to apply requirement of an exact URL match.</li>\n<li>exact can also be used as a flag instead of a reg. property value.</li>\n<li>benefit of adding this is so that you don’t trigger other matches. Switching between routes</li>\n<li>&#x3C;Switch> : Component allows you to only render one route even if several match the current URL.</li>\n<li>You may nest as many routes as you wish but only the first match of the current URL will be rendered.</li>\n<li>Very useful if we want a default component to render if none of our routes match.</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>DefaultComponent will only render if none of the other URLs match up.</li>\n<li>&#x3C;Redirect> : Helps redirect users.</li>\n<li>Only takes a single prop: to.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>History</p>\n<ul>\n<li>History allows you to update the URL programmatically.</li>\n<li>Contains two useful methods:</li>\n<li>push : Adds a new URL to the end of the history stack.</li>\n<li>replace : Replaces the current URL on the history stack, so the back button won't take you to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Nested Routes</h1>\n<p>Why nested routes?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create routes that tunnel into main components vs getting rendered on the main page as it’s own thing. What are nested routes?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alt. version using props.match</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As you can see above, our end URL isn’t even defined until we apply those flexible values in.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>React Builds</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Build : Process of converting code into something that can actually execute or run on the target platform.</li>\n<li>In regards to React, the minimum a build should do is convert JSX to something that browsers can understand. Reviewing common terminology</li>\n<li>Linting : Process of using a tool to analyze your code to catch common errors, bugs, inconsistencies etc...</li>\n<li>Transpilation : Process of converting source code, like JS, from one version to another.</li>\n<li>Minification : Process of removing all unnecessary characters in your code.</li>\n<li>Bundling : Process of combining multiple code files into a single file.</li>\n<li>Tree Shaking : Process of removing unused or dead code from your application before it's bundled. Configuration or code?</li>\n<li>Configuration allows developers to create build tasks by declaring either JSON, XML, or YAML without explicitly writing every step in the process.</li>\n<li>Coding or Scripting simply requires code. Babel and webpack (yes, that's intentionally a lowercase 'w')</li>\n<li>Babel : Code Transpiler that allows you to use all of the latest features and syntax wihtout worrying about what browsers support what.</li>\n<li>webpack : Allows developers to use JS modules w/o requiring users to use a browser that natively supports ES modules.</li>\n<li>Create React App uses webpack and Babel under the hood to build applications. The Create React App build process</li>\n<li>What happens when you run npm start:</li>\n<li>.env variables are loaded.</li>\n<li>list of browsers to support are checked.</li>\n<li>config’d HTTP port checked for availability.</li>\n<li>application compiler is configured and created.</li>\n<li>webpack-dev-starter is started</li>\n<li>webpack-dev-starter compiles app.</li>\n<li>index.html is loaded into browser</li>\n<li>file watcher is started to watch for changes. Ejecting</li>\n<li>There is a script in Create React App called eject that allows you to 'eject' your application and expose all the hidden stuff.

What is state?</li>\n<li>Props are data that are provided by the consumer or caller of the component.</li>\n<li>Not meant to be changed by a component.</li>\n<li>State is data that is internal to the component.</li>\n<li>Intended to be updated or mutated. When to use state</li>\n<li><em>Only Use State when it is absolutely necessary</em></li>\n<li>If the data never changes, or if it’s needed through an entire application use props instead.</li>\n<li>State is more often used when creating components that retrieve data from APIs or render forms.</li>\n<li>The general rule of thumb: If a component doesn’t need to use state or lifecyle methods, it should be prioritized as a function component.</li>\n<li>Functional:Stateless || Class:Stateful Initializing state</li>\n<li>Use a class constructor method to initialize this.state object. // Application Entry Point</li>\n</ul>\n<p>// Class Component: RandomQuote</p>\n<p>Updating State</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let’s say we want to update our state with a new quote.</li>\n<li>We can set up event listeners in React similarly to how we did them before.</li>\n<li>&#x3C;button type=”button” onClick={this.changeQuote}> Change Quote &#x3C;/button></li>\n<li>onClick is the event listener.</li>\n<li>{this.changeQuote} is the event handler method.</li>\n<li>Our Class Component File should now look like this with the new additions:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don’t modify state directly</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is important to never modify your state directly!</li>\n<li>ALWAYS use this.setState method to update state.</li>\n<li>This is because when you only use this.state to re-assign, no re-rendering will occur => leaving our component out of sync. Properly updating state from the previous state</li>\n<li>In our current example, the way we have changeQuote set up leaves us with occasionally producing the same index twice in a row.</li>\n<li>One solution is to design a loop but keep in mind that state updates are handled asynchronously in React (your current value is not guaranteed to be the latest)</li>\n<li>A safe method is to pass an anonymous method to this.setState (instead of an object literal) Previous</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Passing w/ Anon Method</p>\n<p>Providing default values for props</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In our current example, we pass in a static array of predefined quotes in our constructor.</li>\n<li>The way it is set up right now leaves our list of quotes unchanged after initialization.</li>\n<li>We can make quotes more dynamic by replacing our static array with a props argument passed into super.</li>\n<li>constructor(props) { super(props); }</li>\n<li>We can now move our quotes array to our application entry point and pass it in as a prop. // Application Entry Point</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>One thing to note about this workaround is that the caller of the component <em>must</em> set the quotes prop or the component will throw an error => so use defaultProps!</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>A good safety net in case the consumer/caller doesn’t provide a value for the quotes array.</li>\n<li>We can even remove it from our index.js now and an error will not be thrown.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Handling Events<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*c24XQBvqBBg0Eztz\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*N7KFfhOZZ7UrY8s4\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*ywV6dO4a4QcGJxK5?q=20\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/0*ywV6dO4a4QcGJxK5\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*Nd73GjTY1PVQtjtQ?q=20\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/0*Nd73GjTY1PVQtjtQ\">\n\n</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>To add an event listener to an element, just define a method to handle the event and associate that method with the element event you are listening for.

React Router is the answer!</p>\n<p>Think of how you have created server-side routes in Express. Take the following URL and server-side route. Notice how the /users/:userId path corresponds with the <a href=\"http://localhost:3000/users/2\">http://localhost:3000/users/2</a> URL to render a specific HTML page.</p>\n<p>In the default React setup, you lose the ability to create routes in the same manner as in Express. This is what React Router aims to solve!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router\">React Router</a> is a frontend routing library that allows you to control which components to display using the browser location. A user can also copy and paste a URL and email it to a friend or link to it from their own website.</p>\n<p>When you finish this article, you should be able to use the following from the react-router-dom library:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#x3C;BrowserRouter> to provide your application access to the react-router-dom library; and</li>\n<li>&#x3C;Route> to connect specific URL paths to specific components you want rendered; and</li>\n<li>&#x3C;Switch> to wrap several Route elements, rendering only one even if several match the current URL; and</li>\n<li>React Router’s match prop to access route path parameters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Getting started with routing</h1>\n<p>Since you are writing single page apps, you don’t want to refresh the page each time you change the browser location. Instead, you want to update the browser location and your app’s response using JavaScript. This is known as client-side routing. You are using React, so you will use React Router to do this.</p>\n<p>Create a simple react project template:</p>\n<p>Then install React Router:</p>\n<p>Now import BrowserRouter from react-router-dom in your entry file:</p>\n<h1>BrowserRouter</h1>\n<p>BrowserRouter is the primary component of the router that wraps your route hierarchy. It creates a React context that passes routing information down to all its descendent components. For example, if you want to give &#x3C;App> and all its children components access to React Router, you would wrap &#x3C;App> like so:</p>\n<p>Now you can route the rendering of certain components to certain URLs (i.e <a href=\"https://www.website.com/profile).\">https://www.website.com/profile</a><a href=\"https://www.website.com/profile).\">).</a></p>\n<h1>HashRouter</h1>\n<p>Alternatively, you could import and use HashRouter from react-router-dom. Links for applications that use &#x3C;HashRouter> would look like <a href=\"https://www.website.com/#/profile\">https://www.website.com/#/profile</a> (with an # between the domain and path).</p>\n<p>You’ll focus on using the &#x3C;BrowserRouter>.</p>\n<h1>Creating frontend routes</h1>\n<p>React Router helps your React application render specific components based on the URL. The React Router component you’ll use most often is &#x3C;Route>.</p>\n<p>The &#x3C;Route> component is used to wrap another component, causing that component to only be rendered if a certain URL is matched. The behavior of the &#x3C;Route> component is controlled by the following props: path, component, exact, and render (optional).</p>\n<p>Create a simple Users component that returns &#x3C;h1>This is the users index!&#x3C;/h1>. Now let's refactor your index.js file so that you can create your routes within the component:</p>\n<p>Note that BrowserRouter can only have a single child component, so the snippet above wraps all routes within parent a &#x3C;div> element. Now let's create some routes!</p>\n<h1>component</h1>\n<p>Begin with the component prop. This prop takes a reference to the component to be rendered. Let's render your App component:</p>\n<p>Now you’ll need to connect a path to the component!</p>\n<h1>path</h1>\n<p>The wrapped component will only be rendered when the path is matched. The path matches the URL when it matches some initial portion of the URL. For example, a path of / would match both of the following URLs: / and /users. (Because /users begins with a / it matches the path /)</p>\n<p>Take a moment to navigate to <a href=\"http://localhost:3000/users\">http://localhost:3000/users</a> to see how both the App component and Users component are rendering.</p>\n<h1>exact</h1>\n<p>If this exact flag is set, the path will only match when it exactly matches the URL. Then browsing to the /users path would no longer match / and only the Users component will be rendered (instead of both the App component and Users component).</p>\n<h1>render</h1>\n<p>This is an optional prop that takes in a function to be called. The function will be called when the path matches. The function’s return value is rendered. You could also define a functional component inside the component prop, but this results in extra, unnecessary work for React. The render prop is preferred for inline rendering of simple functional components.</p>\n<p>The difference between using component and render is that component returns new JSX to be re-mounted every time the route renders, while render simply returns to JSX what will be mounted once and re-rendered. For any given route, you should only use either the component prop, or the render prop. If both are supplied, only the component prop will be used.</p>\n<p>It can be helpful to use render instead of component in your &#x3C;Route> when you need to pass props into the rendered component. For example, imagine that you needed to pass the users object as a prop to your Users component. Then you could pass in props from Root to Users by returning the Users component like so:</p>\n<p>As a reminder, BrowserRouter can only have a single child component. That's why you have wrapped all your routes within parent a &#x3C;div> element.</p>\n<p>With this Root component, you will always render the &#x3C;h1>Hi, I'm Root!&#x3C;/h1>, regardless of the path. Because of the first &#x3C;Route>, you will only render the App component if the path exactly matches /. Because of the second &#x3C;Route>, you will only render the Users component if the path matches /users.</p>\n<h1>Route path params</h1>\n<p>A component’s props can also hold information about a URL’s parameters. The router will match route segments starting at : up to the next /, ?, or #. Those matched values are then passed to components via their props. Such segments are <em>wildcard</em> values that make up your route parameters.</p>\n<p>For example, take the route below:</p>\n<p>The router would break down the full /users/:userId/photos path to two parts: /users, :userId.</p>\n<p>The Profile component's props would have access to the :userId part of the <a href=\"http://localhost:3000/users/:userId/photos\">http://localhost:3000/users/:userId/photos</a> URL through the props with router parameter information. You would access the the match prop's parameters (props.match.params). If you are using the render prop of the Route component, make sure to spread the props back into the component if you want it to know about the \"match\" parameters.</p>\n<p>The params object would then have a property of userId which would hold the value of the :userId <em>wildcard</em> value. Let's render the userId parameter in a user profile component. Take a moment to create a Profile.js file with the following code:</p>\n<p>Notice how it uses the match prop to access the :userId parameter from the URL. You can use this wildcard to make and AJAX call to fetch the user information from the database and render the return data in the Profile component. Recall that your Profile component was rendered at the path /users/:userId. Thus you can use your userId parameters from match.params to fetch a specific user:</p>\n<h1>Match</h1>\n<p>Now that you’ve seen your React Router’s match prop in action, let's go over more about <a href=\"https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route/route-props\">route props</a>! React Router passes information to the components as route props, accessible to all components with access to the React Router. The three props it makes available are location, match and history. You've learned about props.match.params, but now let's review the other properties of the match prop!</p>\n<p>This is an object that contains important information about how the current URL matches the route path. Here are some of the more useful keys on the match object:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>isExact: a boolean that tells you whether or not the URL exactly matches the path</li>\n<li>url: the current URL</li>\n<li>path: the route path it matched against (without wildcards filled in)</li>\n<li>params: the matches for the individual wildcard segments, nested under their names</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you use React Router, the browser location and history are a part of the state of your app. You can store information about which component should be displayed, which user profile you are currently viewing, or any other piece of state, in the browser location. You can then access that information from anywhere your Router props are passed to in your app.</p>\n<p>Now that you’ve learned about parameters and route props, let’s revisit your Root component to add an exact flag to your /users route so that it does not render with your /users/:userId route. Your component should look something like this:</p>\n<h1>What you learned</h1>\n<p>In this article, you learned how to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use components from the React Router library; and</li>\n<li>Create routes to render specific components; and</li>\n<li>Manage the order of rendered routes; and</li>\n<li>Use the exact flag to ensure that a specific path renders a specific component; and</li>\n<li>Use the React Router match prop to access Router params.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>React Router Navigation</h1>\n<p>Now that you know how to create front-end routes with React Router, you’ll need to implement a way for your users to navigate the routes! This is what using React Router’s Link, NavLink, Redirect, and history prop can help you do.</p>\n<p>In this article, you’ll be working off of the demo project you built in the React Router Intro reading. When you finish this article, you should be able to use the following components from the react-router-dom library:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#x3C;Link> or &#x3C;NavLink> to create links with absolute paths to routes in your application (like \"/users/1\"); and,</li>\n<li>&#x3C;Redirect> to redirect a user to another path (i.e. a login page when the user is not logged in); and</li>\n<li>React Router’s history prop to update a browser's URL programmatically.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Adding links for navigation</h1>\n<p>React Router’s &#x3C;Link> is one way to simplify navigation around your app. It issues an on-click navigation event to a route defined in your app's router. Using &#x3C;Link> renders an anchor tag with a correctly set href attribute.</p>\n<h1>Link</h1>\n<p>To use it, update your imports from the react-router-dom package to include Link:</p>\n<p>Note that &#x3C;Link> can take two props: to and onClick.</p>\n<p>The to prop is a route location description that points to an absolute path, (i.e. /users). Add the following Link components in your index.js file above your routes:</p>\n<p>The onClick prop is just like any other JSX click handler. You can write a function that takes in an event and handles it. Add the following Link before your routes and the following click handler function within your Root component:</p>\n<p>Now, test your routes and links! If you inspect the page, you’ll see that your links are now rendered as &#x3C;a> elements. Notice that clicking the App with click handler link logs a message in your console while directing your browser to render the App component.</p>\n<h1>NavLink</h1>\n<p>The &#x3C;NavLink> works just like a &#x3C;Link>, but with a little extra functionality. It has the ability to add extra styling when the path it links to matches the current path. This makes it an ideal choice for a navigation bar, hence the name. This styling can be controlled by three extra props: activeClassName, activeStyle, and exact. To begin using NavLink, update your imports from the react-router-dom package:</p>\n<p>The activeClassName prop of the NavLink component allows you to set a CSS class name for styling the NavLink when its route is active. By default, the activeClassName is already set to active. This means that you simply need to add an .active class to your CSS file to add active styling to your link. A NavLink will be active if its to prop path matches the current URL.</p>\n<p>Let’s change your “Users”, “Hello”, and “Andrew’s Profile” links to be different colors and have a larger font size when active.</p>\n<p>For example, this is what the rendered HTML &#x3C;a> tag would look like when when the browser is navigated to the / path or the /users path:</p>\n<p>Import NavLink into your index.js file and take a moment to update all your Link elements to NavLink elements. Set an activeClassName prop to an active class. Add the following .active class to your index.css file:</p>\n<p>Test your styled links! Notice how the App and App with click handler links are always bolded. This is because all of your links include the / path, meaning that the link to / will be active when browsing to /users and /users/1 because of how users and users/1 are both prefaced by a /.</p>\n<p>The activeStyle prop is a style object that will be applied inline to the NavLink when its to prop matches the current URL. Add the following activeStyle to your App link and comment out the .active class in your CSS file.</p>\n<p>The following html is rendered when at the / path:</p>\n<p>Notice how your App with click handler is not bolded anymore. This is because the default active class being applied does not have any CSS stylings set to the class. Uncomment your .active class in your CSS file to bring back bolding to this NavLink.</p>\n<p>The exact prop is a boolean that defaults to false. If set to true, then the activeStyle and activeClassName props will only be applied when the current URL exactly matches the to prop. Update your App and App with click handler links with an exact prop set. Just like in your routes, you can use the exact flag instead of exact={true}.</p>\n<p>Now your App and App with click handler links will only be bolded when you have navigated precisely to the / path.</p>\n<h1>Switching between routes</h1>\n<p>You came across styling issues when the /users and /users/1 paths matched the / path. Routing can have this issue as well. This is why you need to control the switching between routes.</p>\n<p>React Router’s &#x3C;Switch> component allows you to only render one &#x3C;Route> even if several match the current URL. You can nest as many Routes as you wish between the opening and closing Switch tags, but only the first one that matches the current URL will be rendered.</p>\n<p>This is particularly useful if you want a default component that will only render if none of our other routes match. View the example below. Without the Switch, DefaultComponent would always render. Since there isn't set a path in the DefaultComponent route, it will simply use the default path of /. Now the DefaultComponent will only render when neither of the preceding routes match.</p>\n<p>Import Switch from react-router-dom and add &#x3C;Switch> tags around your routes to take care of ordering and switching between your routes! Begin by adding the following route to the bottom of your routes to render that a 404: Page not found message:</p>\n<p>This is what your Root component should look like at this point:</p>\n<p>Now you have control over the precedence of rendered components! Try navigating to <a href=\"http://localhost:3000/asdf\">http://localhost:3000/asdf</a> or any other route you have not defined. The &#x3C;h1>404: Page not found&#x3C;/h1> JSX of the last &#x3C;Route> will be rendered whenever the browser attempts to visit an undefined route.</p>\n<h1>Redirecting users</h1>\n<p>But what if you want to redirect users to a login page when they aren’t logged in? The &#x3C;Redirect> component from React Router helps you redirect users!</p>\n<p>The component takes only one prop: to. When it renders, it replaces the current URL with the value of its to prop. Typically you conditionally render &#x3C;Redirect> to redirect the user away from some page you don't want them to visit. The example below checks whether there is a defined currentUser prop. If so, the &#x3C;Route> will render the Home component. Otherwise, it will redirect the user to the /login path.</p>\n<p>Note: you will learn how to use a more flexible auth pattern — don’t directly imitate this example.</p>\n<h1>History</h1>\n<p>You know how to redirect users with a &#x3C;Redirect> component, but what if you need to redirect users programmatically? You've learned about the React Router's match prop, but now let's go over another one of the <a href=\"https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route/route-props\">route props</a>: history!</p>\n<p>This prop lets you update the URL programmatically. For example, suppose you want to push a new URL when the user clicks a button. It has two useful methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>push - This adds a new URL to the end of the history stack. That means that clicking the back button will take the browser to the previous URL. Note that pushing the same URL multiple times in a row will have no effect; the URL will still only show up on the stack once. In development mode, pushing the same URL twice in a row will generate a console warning. This warning is disabled in production mode.</li>\n<li>replace - This replaces the current URL on the history stack, so the back button won't take you to it. For example:</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>What you learned</h1>\n<p>In this article, you learned how to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create navigation links for your route paths; and</li>\n<li>Redirect users through using the &#x3C;Redirect> component; and</li>\n<li>Update a browser’s URL programmatically by using React Router’s history prop.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>React Router Nested Routes<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*233dNJ6vfgAmEVCD?q=20\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/576/0*233dNJ6vfgAmEVCD\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*TKBUkpbL5aSm5PTQ?q=20\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/0*TKBUkpbL5aSm5PTQ\">\n\n</h1>\n<p>Now you know how to create front-end routes and add navigation with React Router. When initializing Express projects, you declare static routes. Static routes are routes that are declared when an application is initialized. When using React Router in your application’s initialization, you can declare dynamic routes. React Router introduces dynamic routing, where your routes are created as your application is rendering. This allows you to create nested routes within components!</p>\n<p>In this article, let’s dive into <a href=\"https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/guides/philosophy/nested-routes\">nested routes</a>! When you finish the article, you should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe what nested routes are; and</li>\n<li>Be able to use React Router to create and navigate nested routes; and</li>\n<li>Know how to use the React Router match prop to generate links and routes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Why nested routes?</h1>\n<p>Let’s begin with why you might need nested routes. As you remember, you are using React to create a single-page application. This means that you’ll be organizing your application into different components and sub-components.</p>\n<p>For example, imagine creating a simple front-end application with three main pages: a home welcome page (path of /), a users index page (path of /users), and user profile pages (path of /users/:userId). Now imagine if every user had links to separate posts and photos pages.</p>\n<p>You can create those routes and links within the user profile component, instead of creating the routes and links where the main routes are defined.</p>\n<h1>What are nested routes?</h1>\n<p>Now let’s dive into a user profile component to understand what are nested routes! Imagine you have a route in your application’s entry file to each user’s profile like so:</p>\n<p>This means that upon navigating to <a href=\"http://localhost:3000/users/1\">http://localhost:3000/users/1</a>, you would render the following Profile component and the userId parameter within props.match.params would have the value of \"1\".</p>\n<p>Since this route is not created until the Profile component is rendered, you are dynamically creating your nested /users/:userId/posts and /users/:userId/photos routes. Remember that your match prop also has other helpful properties. You can use match.url instead of /users/${id} in your profile links. You can also use match.path instead of /users/:userId in your profile routes. Remember that you can destructure url, path, and params from your match prop!</p>\n<p>In tomorrow’s project, you’ll build a rainbow of routes as well as define nested routes. In the future, you may choose to implement nested routes to keep your application’s routes organized within related components.</p>\n<h1>What you learned</h1>\n<p>In this article, you learned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What nested routes are; and</li>\n<li>About creating and navigating nested routes with React Router; and</li>\n<li>How to use the React Router props to generate nested links and routes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>React Builds</h1>\n<p>A “build” is the process of converting code into something that can actually execute or run on the target platform. A “front-end build” is a process of preparing a front-end or client-side application for the browser.</p>\n<p>With React applications, that means (at a minimum) converting JSX to something that browsers can actually understand. When using Create React App, the build process is automatically configured to do that and a lot more.</p>\n<p>When you finish this article, you should be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe what front-end builds are and why they’re needed;</li>\n<li>Describe at a high level what happens in a Create React App when you run npm start; and</li>\n<li>Prepare to deploy a React application into a production environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Understanding front-end builds</h1>\n<p>The need for front-end builds predates React. Over the years, developers have found it helpful to extend the lowest common denominator version of JavaScript and CSS that they could use.</p>\n<p>Sometimes developers extend JavaScript and CSS with something like <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">TypeScript</a> or <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a>. Using these non-standard languages and syntaxes require you to use a build process to convert your code into standard JavaScript and CSS that can actually run in the browser.</p>\n<p>Browser-based applications also require a fair amount of optimization to deliver the best, or at least acceptable, experience to end users. Front-end build processes could be configured to lint code, run unit tests, optimize images, minify and bundle code, and more — all automatically at the press of a button (i.e. running a command at the terminal).</p>\n<h1>JavaScript versions and the growth of front-end builds</h1>\n<p>Developers are generally an impatient lot. When new features are added to JavaScript, we don’t like to wait for browsers to widely support those features before we start to use them in our code. And we <em>really</em> don’t like when we have to support older, legacy versions of browsers.</p>\n<p>In recent years, JavaScript has been updated on a yearly basis and browser vendors do a decent job of updating their browsers to support the new features as they’re added to the language. Years ago though, there was an infamous delay between versions 5 and 6 of JavaScript. It took <em>years</em> before ES6 (or ES2015 as it eventually was renamed to) to officially be completed and even longer before browsers supported all of its features.</p>\n<p>In the period of time before ES2015 was broadly supported by browsers, developers used front-end builds to convert or <em>transpile</em> ES2015 features and syntax to an older version of the language that was more broadly supported by browsers (typically ES5). The transpilation from ES2015/ES6 down to ES5 was one of the major drivers for developers to add front-end builds to their client-side projects.</p>\n<h1>Reviewing common terminology</h1>\n<p>When learning about front-end or React builds, you’ll encounter a lot of terminology that you may or may not be familiar with. Here’s some of the terminology that you’ll likely encounter:</p>\n<p>Linting is process of using a tool to analyze your code to catch common programming errors, bugs, stylistic inconsistencies, and suspicious coding patterns. <a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">ESLint</a> is a popular JavaScript linting tool.</p>\n<p>Transpilation is the process of converting source code, like JavaScript, from one version to another version. Usually this means converting newer versions of JavaScript, <a href=\"https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html\">ES2019</a> or <a href=\"https://tc39.es/ecma262/\">ES2021</a>, to a version that’s more widely supported by browsers, like <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/\">ES2015</a>, or even <a href=\"https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/\">ES5</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%203rd%20edition,%20December%201999.pdf\">ES3</a> (if you need to support the browser that your parents or grandparents use).</p>\n<p>Minification is the process of removing all unnecessary characters in your code (e.g. white space characters, new line characters, comments) to produce an overall smaller file. Minification tools will often also rename identifers in your code (i.e. parameter and variable names) in the quest for smaller and smaller file sizes. Source maps can also be generated to allow debugging tools to cross reference between minified code and the original source code.</p>\n<p>Bundling is the process of combining multiple code files into a single file. Creating a bundle (or a handful of bundles) reduces the number of requests that a client needs to make to the server.</p>\n<p>Tree shaking is the process of removing unused (or dead) code from your application before it’s bundled. Tree shaking external dependencies can sometimes have a dramatic positive impact on overall bundled file sizes.</p>\n<h1>Configuration or code?</h1>\n<p>Front-end build tools have come and gone over the years; sometimes very quickly, which helped bring about the phenomenon known as <a href=\"https://sdtimes.com/softwaredev/is-the-javascript-fatigue-real/\">JavaScript fatigue</a>.</p>\n<p>Configuration based tools allow you to create your build tasks by declaring (usually using JSON, XML, or YAML) what you want to be done, without explicitly writing every step in the process. In contrast, coding or scripting based tools allow you to, well, write code to create your build tasks. Configuration based tools <em>can</em> sometimes feel simpler to use while giving up some control (at least initially) while coding based tools <em>can</em> feel more familiar and predictable (since you’re describing tasks procedurally). Every generalization is false though (including this one), so there are plenty of exceptions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gruntjs.com/\">Grunt</a> is a JSON configuration based task runner that can be used to orchestrate the various tasks that make up your front-end build. Grunt was very quickly supplanted by <a href=\"https://gulpjs.com/\">Gulp</a>, which allowed developers to write JavaScript to define front-end build tasks. After Gulp, the front-end tooling landscape became a bit more muddled. Some developers preferred the simplicity of using <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts\">npm scripts</a> to define build tasks while others preferred the power of configuration based bundlers like <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\">webpack</a>.</p>\n<h1>Babel and webpack (yes, that’s intentionally a lowercase ‘w’)</h1>\n<p>As front-end or client-side applications grew in complexity, developers found themselves wanting to leverage more advanced JavaScript features and newer syntax like classes, arrow functions, destructuring, async/await, etc. Using a code transpiler, like <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a>, allows you to use all of the latest and greatest features and syntax without worrying about what browsers support what.</p>\n<p>Module loaders and bundlers, like <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\">webpack</a>, also allowed developers to use JavaScript modules without requiring users to use a browser that natively supports ES modules. Also, module bundling (along with minification and tree-shaking) helps to reduce the bandwidth that’s required to deliver the assets for your application to the client.</p>\n<p>[Create React App][cra] uses webpack (along with Babel) under the covers to build your React applications. Even if you’re not using Create React App, webpack and Babel are still very popular choices for building React applications.</p>\n<h1>Pulling back the covers (a bit) on the Create React App build process</h1>\n<p>Running an application created by Create React App using npm start can feel magical. Some stuff happens in the terminal and your application opens into your default browser. Even better, when you make changes to your application, your changes will (usually) automatically appear in the browser!</p>\n<h1>The Create React App build process</h1>\n<p>At a high level, here’s what happens when you run npm start:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Environment variables are loaded (more about this in a bit);</li>\n<li>The list of browsers to support are checked (more about this too in a bit);</li>\n<li>The configured HTTP port is checked to ensure that it’s available;</li>\n<li>The application compiler is configured and created;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/\">webpack-dev-server</a> is started;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/\">webpack-dev-server</a> compiles your application;</li>\n<li>The index.html file is loaded into the browser; and</li>\n<li>A file watcher is started to watch your files, waiting for changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Ejecting</h1>\n<p>Create React App provides a script that you can run to “eject” your application from the Create React App tooling. When you eject your application, all of the hidden stuff is exposed so that you can review and customize it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The need to customize Create React App rarely happens. Also, don’t eject an actual project as it’s a one-way trip! Once a Create React App project has been ejected, there’s no going back (though you could always undo the ejection process by reverting to an earlier commit if you’re using source control).</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To eject your application from Create React App, run the command npm run eject. You'll be prompted if you want to continue; type \"y\" to continue with the ejection process. Once the ejection process has completed, you can review the files that were previously hidden from you.</p>\n<p>In the package.json file, you'll see the following npm scripts:</p>\n<p>You can open the ./scripts/start.js file to see the code that's executed when you run npm start.</p>\n<p>If you’re curious about the webpack configuration, you can open and review the ./config/webpack.config.js.</p>\n<h1>Preparing to deploy a React application for production</h1>\n<p>Before you deploy your application to production, you’ll want to make sure that you’ve replaced static values in your code with environment variables and considered what browsers you need to support.</p>\n<h1>Defining environment variables</h1>\n<p>Create React App supports defining environment variables in an .env file. To define an environment variable, add an .env file to your project and define one or more variables that start with the prefix REACT<em>APP\\</em>:</p>\n<p>Environment variables can be used in code like this:</p>\n<p>You can also reference environment variables in your index.html like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Important: Environment variables are embedded into your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript bundles during the build process. Because of this, it’s very important to not store any secrets, like API keys, in your environment variables as anyone can view your bundled code in the browser by inspecting your files.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Configuring the supported browsers</h1>\n<p>In your project’s package.json file, you can see the list of targeted browsers:</p>\n<p>Adjusting these targets affect how your code will be transpiled. Specifying older browser versions will result in your code being transpiled to older versions of JavaScript in order to be compatible with the specified browser versions. The production list specifies the browsers to target when creating a production build and the development list specifics the browsers to target when running the application using npm start.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://browserl.ist/\">browserl.ist</a> website can be used to see the browsers supported by your configured browserslist.</p>\n<h1>Creating a production build</h1>\n<p>To create a production build, run the command npm run build. The production build process bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. When the command completes, you'll find your production ready files in the build folder.</p>\n<p>Now your application is ready to be deployed!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>For more information about how to deploy a Create React App project into production, see _[</em>this page<em>](<a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment\">https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment</a>)</em> in the official documentation._</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>What you learned</h1>\n<p>In this article, you learned how to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe what front-end builds are and why they’re needed;</li>\n<li>Describe at a high level what happens in a Create React App when you run npm start; and</li>\n<li>Prepare to deploy a React application into a production environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>React Router Documentation</h1>\n<p>Now that you’ve had an introduction to React Router, feel free to explore the official documentation to learn more!

The goal is to create a basic app that displays the colors of the rainbow. This rainbow, however, has something special about it — some of the colors are nested within others.</p>\n<h1>Phase 0: Setup</h1>\n<p>Begin by creating a new React project:</p>\n<p>Now you’ll remove all the contents of your src and all the contents from your public directory to build the application architecture from scratch! After you have deleted all your files within the directories, create a new index.html file in your public folder. Use the html:5 emmet shortcut to generate an HTML template. Title your page \"Rainbow Routes\" and create a div with an id of root in your DOM's &#x3C;body> element. Create an index.css file in your src directory with the following code. Now let's create your entry file!</p>\n<p>Create an index.js entry file in the src directory. At the top of the file, make sure to import React from the react package and ReactDOM from the react-dom package. Make sure to also import your the index.css file you just created! This will take care of styling your <em>rainbow routes</em>.</p>\n<p>Now you can use the ReactDOM.render() method to render a &#x3C;Root /> component instead of the DOM element with an id of root. Lastly, wrap your render function with a DOMContentLoaded event listener, like so:</p>\n<p>Let’s create your Root component right in your entry file! Your Root component will take care of applying your BrowserRouter to the application. Applying the BrowserRouter to your Root component allows all the child components rendering within &#x3C;BrowserRouter> tags to use and access the Route, Link, and NavLink components within the react-router-dom package.</p>\n<p>Install the react-router-dom package:</p>\n<p>Now import BrowserRouter from the react-router-dom package, like so:</p>\n<p>You’re going to be rendering a lot of components, so let’s keep your src directory organized by creating a components directory within. Within your new ./src/components directory, create a Rainbow.js file for your Rainbow component with the following code:</p>\n<p>Your Rainbow component will act as the home page or default path (/) of your application. Import the Rainbow component into your entry file and have your Root component render &#x3C;Rainbow /> wrapped within &#x3C;BrowserRouter> tags, like so:</p>\n<p>Within your Rainbow component, you'll be rendering &#x3C;NavLink> and &#x3C;Route> components to add different navigation paths to different components. Let's create all the components you will render!</p>\n<p>Create files for the following components in your ./src/components directory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Red</li>\n<li>Blue</li>\n<li>Green</li>\n<li>Indigo</li>\n<li>Orange</li>\n<li>Violet</li>\n<li>Yellow</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your Red and Blue components will look something like this:</p>\n<p>Your Green, Indigo, Orange, Violet, and Yellow components will look something like this:</p>\n<p>Now start your server and verify you can see the “Rainbow Router!” header from your Rainbow component. Currently there is no functionality. Let's fix that!</p>\n<h1>Phase 1: Routes</h1>\n<p>As a reminder, wrapping the Rainbow component in &#x3C;BrowserRouter> tags makes the router available to all descendent React Router components. Now open the Rainbow.js file. You're going to render some of your color components from here. Ultimately you want your routes to look like this.</p>\n<p>URLComponents/Rainbow/redRainbow -> Red/red/orangeRainbow -> Red -> Orange/red/yellowRainbow -> Red -> Yellow/greenRainbow -> Green/blueRainbow -> Blue/blue/indigoRainbow -> Blue -> Indigo/violetRainbow -> Violet</p>\n<p>This means that the Red, Green, Blue, and Violet components need to render in the Rainbow component, but only when you are at the corresponding URL. You'll do this with Route components. Begin by importing the Red, Green, Blue, and Violet components into your Rainbow.js file. Then add the necessary Route components inside the div with id=\"rainbow\" in the Rainbow component. For example to render the Red component with the /red path, you would use the following Route component:</p>\n<p>Test that your code works! Manually type in each URL you just created, and you should see the color component pop up. Remember, these are React Routes, so the paths you created will come after the /. For example, your default rainbow route will look like <a href=\"http://localhost:3000/\">http://localhost:3000/</a> while your red route will look like <a href=\"http://localhost:3000/red.\">http://localhost:3000/red</a><a href=\"http://localhost:3000/red.\">.</a></p>\n<p>You want to nest the Orange and Yellow components inside the Red component, and the Indigo component inside the Blue component. Remember to import your components to use them in a Route tag. You'll have to go add the corresponding Route tags to the Red.js and Blue.js files. Make sure to use the correct nested paths, such as \"/red/orange\" for the orange Route.</p>\n<h1>Phase 2: Links</h1>\n<p>Manually navigating to our newly created routes is tiresome, so let’s add functionality to take care of this process for us. React Router provides the Link and NavLink components for this purpose.</p>\n<p>Add Links to the paths /red, /green, /blue, and /violet in the Rainbow component. For example, your red link should look like</p>\n<p>When you are at blue you want to be able to get to /blue/indigo, and then back to /blue. Add the corresponding Links to the Blue component like this:</p>\n<p>Similarly, add Links to /red, /red/orange and /red/yellow to the Red component. Test all your links. Navigation is so much easier now!</p>\n<h1>Phase 3: NavLinks</h1>\n<p>It would be nice if our links gave us some indication of which route you were at. Fortunately, React Router has a special component for that very purpose: NavLink. NavLinks get an extra CSS class when their to prop matches the current URL. By default this class is called active.</p>\n<p>Go ahead and switch all your Links to NavLinks. If you open the app you won't see any change yet. That's because you haven't added any special styling to the active class. Go ahead and open the index.css file. Create an .active class and add the line font-weight: 700. Now your active links will be bold. Isn't that nice!</p>\n<p>The only problem is that now the Blue only link is active even when the path is /blue/indigo. That doesn't make a lot of sense. Let's add the exact flag to that link so it will only be active when its to exactly matches the current path. Now it should look like:</p>\n<p>Do the same for the Red only link. Everything should be working now.</p>\n<h1>Phase 4 — Changing NavLink’s Active Class</h1>\n<p>You’ve already set up NavLink to bold the link text using the .active class in src/index.css. But what if you wanted this class to be something else? For instance, what if you want your main color links (Red, Green, Blue, Violet) to be styled differently when active than your sub-route links (Red Only, Add Orange, Add Yellow, etc.).</p>\n<p>You can set the class that React Router sets to an active NavLink by adding the activeClassName prop.</p>\n<p>For instance, when we are at a route matching the below NavLink's to prop, the component will have a class of .parent-active applied:</p>\n<p>This allows much more flexibility to style an active NavLink!</p>\n<p>Using the example above, add an activeClassName prop to each of your NavLinks in src/components/Rainbow.js. Now, add some CSS styling for that class in your src/index.css to distinguish your main and your sub-route links.</p>\n<p>Compare your work to the solution and make sure the behavior is the same. Time to celebrate! ✨ 🌈 ✨</p>\n<p>You can also learn more about using the React Router at <a href=\"https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start\">reacttraining.com</a>!</p>\n<h1>Exploring React Builds Project</h1>\n<p>In this project, you’ll use Create React App to create a simple React application. You’ll experiment with some of the features that Create React App provides and deploy a production build of your application to a standalone Express application.</p>\n<h1>Phase 0: Setup</h1>\n<p>Begin by using the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app\">create-react-app</a> package to create a React application:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Remember that using the create-react-app command initializes your project as a Git repository. If you use the ls -a to view the hidden files in your project, you'll see the .git file.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Update the App component:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wrap the &#x3C;h1> element with a &#x3C;div> element; and</li>\n<li>Change the &#x3C;h1> element content to something like \"Exploring React Builds\".</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Phase 1: Using CSS modules</h1>\n<p>You’ve already seen an example of using the import keyword to import a stylesheet into a module so that it'll be included in your application build. That's the technique being used to include the global index.css stylesheet:</p>\n<p>You can also leverage <a href=\"https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules\">CSS modules</a> in your Create React App projects. CSS Modules scope stylesheet class names so that they are unique to a specific React component. This allows you to create class names without having to worry if they might collide with class names used in another component.</p>\n<p>Add a new css-modules folder to the src folder. Within that folder, add the following files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HeadingA.js</li>\n<li>HeadingA.module.css</li>\n<li>HeadingB.js</li>\n<li>HeadingB.module.css</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then update the contents of each file to the following:</p>\n<p>Notice how the .heading CSS class name is being used within each component to set the color of the &#x3C;h1> element. For the HeadingA component, the color is green, and for the HeadingB component, the color is red. Using the file naming convention [name].module.css let's Create React App know that we want these stylesheets to be processed as CSS Modules. Using CSS Modules allows the .heading class name to be reused across components without any issue.</p>\n<p>To see this feature in action, update your App component to render both of your new components:</p>\n<p>Then run your application (npm start) to see \"Heading A\" and \"Heading B\" displayed respectively in green and red. If you use the browser's developer tools to inspect \"Heading A\", you'll see that the .heading class name has been modified so that it's unique to the HeadingA component:</p>\n<p>CSS Modules is an example of how a front-end build process can be used to modify code to enable a feature that’s not natively supported by browsers.</p>\n<h1>Phase 2: Using an image in a component</h1>\n<p>Create React App configures webpack with support for loading images (as well as CSS, fonts, and other file types). What this means, for you as the developer, is that you can add an image file to your project, import it directly into a module, and render it in a React component.</p>\n<p>Download any image of off the Web or <a href=\"https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Modular-Curriculum/content/react-redux/topics/react-builds/assets/react-builds-cat.png\">click here</a> to download the below image.</p>\n<p>Then within the src folder add a new folder named image. Within that folder add a new component file named Image.js. Also add your downloaded image file to the image folder (so it's a sibling to the Image.js file).</p>\n<p>Update the contents of the Image.js file to this:</p>\n<p>You can import an image into a component using the import keyword. This tells webpack to include the image in the build. Notice that when you import an image into a module, you'll get a path to the image's location within the build. You can use this path to set the src attribute on an &#x3C;img> element.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Be sure to update the image import statement to the correct file name if you're using your own image!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now update the App component to import and render the Image component:</p>\n<p>If you run your application (npm start) you'll see your image displayed on the page! You can also open your browser's developer tools and view the \"Sources\" for the current page. If you can expand the localhost:3000 > static > media node on the left, you can see the image file that webpack copied to your build.</p>\n<h1>Images in stylesheets</h1>\n<p>You can also reference images in your CSS files too. Add a CSS file named Image.css to the ./src/image folder and update its contents to this:</p>\n<p>Then update the Image component to this:</p>\n<p>Now you’ll see the image displayed twice on the page!</p>\n<h1>Phase 3: Updating the supported browsers (and its affect on code transpilation)</h1>\n<p>Earlier you learned about the browerslist setting in the package.json file and now adjusting these targets affect how your code will be transpiled:</p>\n<p>The production list specifies the browsers to target when creating a production build and the development list specifics the browsers to target when running the application using npm start. Currently, you're targeting relatively recent versions of the major browsers when creating a development build. Targeting older browser versions results in your code being transpiled to an older version of JavaScript.</p>\n<p>To experiment with this configuration option, let’s add a class component to the project. Add a new folder named class-component to the src folder. Within that folder, add a file named ClassComponent.js containing the following code:</p>\n<p>Don’t forget to update your App component to render the new component:</p>\n<p>Now run your application using npm start. Open your browser's developer tools and view the \"Sources\" for the current page. Expand the localhost:3000 > static > js node on the left and select the main.chunk.js file. Press CMD+F on macOS or CTRL+F on Windows to search the file for \"Class Component\". Here's what the transpiled code looks like for the ClassComponent class:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Have you wondered yet why you need to use the developer tools to view the bundles generated by Create React App? Remember that when you run npm start, Create React App builds your application using _[</em>webpack-dev-server<em>](<a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/\">https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/</a>)</em>. To keep things as performant as possible, the bundles generated by <em>[</em>webpack-dev-server<em>](<a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/\">https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/</a>)</em> are stored in memory instead of writing them to the file system._</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The JSX in the component’s render method has been converted to JavaScript but the ClassComponent ES2015 class is left alone. This makes sense though as JSX isn't natively supported by any browser while ES2015 classes have been natively supported by browsers for awhile now.</p>\n<p>But what if you need to target a version of a browser that doesn’t support ES2015 classes? You can use the <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-class\">“Can I use…”</a> website to see when browsers started supporting ES2105 (or ES6) classes. Starting with version 49, Chrome natively supported classes. But imagine that you need to support Chrome going back to version 30, a version of Chrome that doesn’t support classes.</p>\n<p>Change the browserslist.development property in the package.json file to this:</p>\n<p>The query chrome >= 30 specifies that you want to target Chrome version 30 or newer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The _[</em>browserl.ist<em>](<a href=\"https://browserl.ist/\">https://browserl.ist/</a>)</em> website can be used to see the browsers supported by your configured browserslist._</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Stop your application if it’s currently running. Delete the ./node_modules/.cache folder and run npm start again. Then view the main.chunk.js bundle again in the developer tools:</p>\n<p>Now your ES2015 class component is being converted to a constructor function! Here’s the transpiled code for reference:</p>\n<p>Luckily it’s very rare that you’ll need to read the code in your generated bundles. webpack, by default, is configured to generate sourcemaps. Sourcemaps are a mapping of the code in a generated file, like a bundle file, to the original source code. This gives you access to your original source code in the browser’s developer tools:</p>\n<p>You can even set a breakpoint in your source within the developer tools to stop execution on a specific line of code!</p>\n<h1>Phase 4: Adding environment variables</h1>\n<p>Earlier you learned that Create React App supports defining environment variables in an .env file. This gives you a convenient way to avoid hard coding values that vary across environments.</p>\n<p>Let’s experiment with this feature so that you can see how the Create React App build process embeds environment variables into your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript bundles.</p>\n<p>Add an .env file to the root of your Create React App project. Define an environment variable named REACT<em>APP</em>TITLE:</p>\n<p>Remember that environment variables need to be prefixed with REACT<em>APP</em> for Create React App to process them. After defining your environment variable, you can refer to it within JSX using an expression and process.env:</p>\n<p>Environment variables can also be referred to in regular JavaScript code:</p>\n<p>You can also reference environment variables in your ./public/index.html file like this:</p>\n<p>Run your application again using npm start. Open your browser's developer tools and view the \"Sources\" for the current page. Expand the localhost:3000 node on the left and select (index). Notice that the text %REACT<em>APP</em>TITLE% within the &#x3C;title> element has been converted to the text literal Exploring React Builds:</p>\n<p>If you expand the localhost:3000 > static > js node on the left and select the main.chunk.js file, you can see how the App component's JSX has been converted to JavaScript:</p>\n<p>Here’s a closer look at the relevant React.createElement method call:</p>\n<p>Again, notice how the environment variable has been replaced with a text literal. This has important security implications for you to consider. Because environment variables are embedded into your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript bundles during the build process, it’s <em>very important</em> to not store any secrets, like API keys, in your environment variables. Remember, anyone can view your bundled code in the browser by inspecting your files!</p>\n<h1>Phase 5: Deploying a production build</h1>\n<p>In the last phase of this project, let’s add routing to the React application, create a production build, and deploy the build to an Express application!</p>\n<h1>Adding routing</h1>\n<p>To add React Router to the application, start by installing the react-router-dom npm package:</p>\n<p>Then update the App component to this code:</p>\n<p>Be sure to run and test your application to ensure that the defined routes work as expected:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>/ - Should display the HeadingA and HeadingB components;</li>\n<li>/image - Should display the Image component; and</li>\n<li>/class-component - Should display the ClassComponent component.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Creating a production build</h1>\n<p>To create a production build, run the command npm run build from the root of your project. The output in the terminal should look something like this:</p>\n<p>Ignore the comments about using serve to deploy your application (i.e. npm install -g serve and serve -s build). In the next step, you'll create a simple Express application to server your React application.</p>\n<h1>Serving a React application using Express</h1>\n<p>Create a new folder for your Express application outside of the Create React App project folder.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>For example, from the root of your project, use cd .. to go up a level and then create a new folder named express-server by running the command mkdir express-server. This makes the express-server folder a sibling to your Create React App project folder.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Browse into the express-server folder and initialize it to use npm (i.e. npm init -y). Then install Express by running the command npm install express@^4.0.0.</p>\n<p>App a file named app.js with the following contents:</p>\n<p>This simple Express application will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attempt to match incoming requests to static files located in the public folder; and</li>\n<li>If a matching static file isn’t found, then the ./public/index.html file will be served for all other requests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now add a folder named public to the root of your Express project. Copy the files from the build folder in your Create React App project to the public folder in the Express application project. Then run your application using the command node app.js.</p>\n<p>Open a browser and browse to the URL <a href=\"http://localhost:9000/\">http://localhost:9000/</a>. You should see your React application served from your Express application! Be sure to click the navigation links to verify that all of your configured routes work as expected.</p>\n<p>Also, because you configured Express to serve the ./public/index.html file for any request that doesn't match a static file, you can \"deep link\" to any of your React application's routes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://localhost:9000/image\">http://localhost:9000/image</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://localhost:9000/class-component\">http://localhost:9000/class-component</a></li>\n</ul>"}
